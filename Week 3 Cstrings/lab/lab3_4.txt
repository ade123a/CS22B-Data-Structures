This Memorial Day I hosted a BBQ in my <place>. 
At first I worried nobody would show up because <person> 
was the only person there for <number> hours. 
Just when I had given up hope, all of my family and 
<celebrity> arrived. We fired up the <thing> to cook 
our burgers and everyone ate my <food> salad while we waited. 
After eating, someone suggested we play <sport>, 
but I didn't have enough <things> for everyone 
so we all decided to <verb> instead. 
As the sun set, we lit a bonfire and I played <song title>
on my <musical instrument> while everyone sang along.
