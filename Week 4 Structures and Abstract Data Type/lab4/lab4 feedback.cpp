Each line is the name, count, and price of an item that the store sells, and the 3 fields are separated by comma.
Dynamically allocate the inventory array so it is the same size as the number of items in the input file.
Loop to fill the inventory array.
The name, count, and price in each line of the input file should be stored in one element of the inventory array.

The transaction function:

Create a vector called receipt, ready to store Item structures
Loop until the user enters "done"
In the loop:
a. print the name and price of each item that has a non-zero count
Print in column format as shown in the sample output
b. keep prompting the user for an item to purchase until you get a valid item name
c. print the count for the item
d. keep prompting the user for the number of items to purchase until you get a valid number
e. process the purchase:
- create a new Item structure to store the name, the number, and the price of the item that the user purchased
- add the new Item structure to the receipt vector
When the loop ends, print the Items in the receipt vector and print the total cost
The receipt should be printed in column format as shown in the sample output

- reduce the item count in the inventory
The transaction function involves a lot of steps so it's your job to break it down into smaller functions that the transaction function can call.
Some example sub-functions are: a print functio
- calculate the total cost as a running sum (keep adding to the sum with every item purchased)n, a search function, a process purchase function, a print receipt function
